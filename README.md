# Industrial-Training-Report-
I am very happy to tell you that polymed pharmaceutical pvt ltd has allowed me for Industrial trainig. This journey is going to be very important for me and my future. As per the ordinance of PCI, it is mandatory for the students to undertake industrial training for 4 weeks in a pharmaceutical manufacturing unit. The training helps the students to understand the industrial scale operations and the use of the latest equipment and instruments. On completion of term, the industry issues a certificate to the students, student prepare industrial training report in duplicate and submit to the college.
